Traffic Network Optimization using Dijkstra's Algorithm

Features

Models a traffic network as a weighted graph.

Runs Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest travel time from any source node.

Outputs optimized travel times from every node to all the nodes within the network.

Used for analyzing and optimizing traffic flow between road intersections.

Technology Used

Language: Python 3

Libraries: heapq (for priority queue operation)

How It Works

1. The traffic network is modeled as a graph in an adjacency list.


2. Dijkstra's algorithm is employed to find the shortest distance from any node to the others.

3. The algorithm is run for each node in the network to calculate travel times from all intersections.

4. The output indicates the optimized travel time between all pair of nodes.

Data Collection

Source: Hardcoded in Python code.

The graph is a sample traffic network.

Each edge is a road segment with a specified travel time (weight).

Objective

To simulate and optimize city traffic flow using Dijkstra's algorithm, which helps identify the shortest and best travel routes between intersections in a road network.

Controls

No user input or GUI.

Simply run the script by python filename.py.

The output is displayed in the terminal/console.

ML Techniques Used

No machine learning used; the project depends on standard graph algorithms.

Model Training

Not applicable (no ML model or training process).

Output Explanation (Optional)

The output displays:

The minimum time to travel from every node (intersection) to every other node.

Helps visualize shortest routes and identify potential bottle necks or traffic jam within the network.
